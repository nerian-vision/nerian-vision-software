 * \brief Class for synchronous transfer of image sets.

 * This class opens a network socket for delivering or receiving image sets. All
 * operations are performed synchronously, which means that they might block.

 * This class is thread safe for as long as sending and receiving data
 * each has its dedicated thread.
 *
 * **Note: For normal applications and typical use cases, we recommend
 * using AsyncTransfer instead, which places network operations into an
 * automatic background thread, decoupled from your own loop timing.**
