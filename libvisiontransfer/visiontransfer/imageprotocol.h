/**
 * \brief A lightweight protocol for transferring image sets.
 *
 * Two images are transferred together as a set. These are usually the left
 * and right image of a stereo camera, or the left image and a disparity map.
 *
 * The images are 8- or 12-bit monochrome, or 8-bit RGB color. For simplicity,
 * 12-bit images are inflated to 16-bit by introducing additional padding
 * bits. Both images must always have the same image size.
 *
 * When receiving, the class takes in an image set and chops it down to several
 * network messages. When sending, the class takes a set of messages and
 * assembles them into an image set. We have to differentiate between TCP and
 * UDP in both cases.
