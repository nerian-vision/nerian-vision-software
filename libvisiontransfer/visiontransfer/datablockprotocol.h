 * \brief A protocol for transmitting large blocks of data over a network.
 *
 * The protocol slices the large data block into several smaller chunks
 * that can be transmitted over a network. A user defined header is
 * always transmitted before this large data block.
 *
 * There are two different implementations for UDP and TCP. In UDP mode,
 * packet loss is handled by performing a packet re-transmission. In TCP
 * mode, data does not have to be received with the same packet size as
 * it is sent out.
 *
 * This class is intended to be used by ImageProtocol and should normally
 * not be used directly.
